    "## Dialogue Summarization: An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Dialogue summarization aims to condense the context of conversations into concise summaries. This task, while conceptually straightforward, involves unique challenges in practice. It demands a nuanced understanding of language, the ability to identify key points, and the skill to maintain the original dialogue's intent and tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience with dialogue summarization, several challenges may emerge:\n",
    "- Capturing the subtleties of conversation without losing the dialogue's overall context.\n",
    "- Effectively processing and interpreting the informal, often unstructured language used in dialogue.\n",
    "- Identifying and summarizing the most crucial elements of a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of LLMs in Dialogue Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs offer promising solutions to these challenges. Their extensive training on diverse datasets enables them to **<i><u>understand and generate human-like text</u></i>**, making them invaluable for different tasks like dialogue summarization. Experiments have shown that with careful prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, LLMs can be guided to produce summaries that are not only coherent and concise but also reflective of the dialogue's original tone and intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personal Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the labs and exercises in this course, I've learned the importance of approaching each summarization task as unique, with its own specific demands and challenges. Prompt engineering, in particular, has stood out as a powerful tool for directing LLMs to better understand and execute the task at hand. As we proceed through these enhanced materials, I aim to share my insights in order to better comprehend them. These insights will be shared through markdown cells for conceptual explanations (marked with \"**<i>My insight</i>**\"), and directly within code cells as comments (marked with \"# My contribution\"), offering a dual perspective on how to understand the models and their outputs more deeply."

    "# Generative AI Use Case: Summarize Dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the practical side of this course. In this lab you will do the dialogue summarization task using generative AI. You will explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task you need. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, you will take the first step towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models."
