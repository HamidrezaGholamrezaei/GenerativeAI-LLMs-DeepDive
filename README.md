# GenerativeAI-LLMs-DeepDive

## Description
Dive deep into the world of Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by and building upon the "Generative AI with Large Language Models" course by DeepLearning.AI and Amazon Web Services on Coursera. This repository is a personal project intended for educational purposes only, offering enhanced course materials with additional insights, analysis, and a collection of unique projects to explore the practical applications of LLMs.

## Recent Updates
- **Week 1 Notebooks Added**: As of April 2, 2024, the repository now includes both the original and enhanced Jupyter notebooks for Week 1 of the "Generative AI with Large Language Models" course. These notebooks are located under `/CourseMaterialEnhanced/Week1/`, where you can find the original course material alongside my enhanced versions featuring additional insights and analysis.

## Repository Structure
Currently, the repository organizes the original course materials along with my personal enhancements. This structure will expand to include additional directories for enhanced notebooks, detailed insights, and projects. As of now, the repository is structured into the following main directories:

- `/CourseMaterialEnhanced/` - Hosts both the original and upcoming enhanced versions of the course notebooks. Each week of the course is represented as a subdirectory, with Week 1 currently available:
  - `Week1/` - Contains the original course notebook and the enhanced version with added personal commentary and insights.
  - `Week2/`, `Week3/` - Planned for future updates to include both original and enhanced versions.
- `/Projects/` - This section, planned for future updates, will contain projects that apply the learned concepts to new challenges or datasets.

Detailed descriptions and updates for each section will be provided as the repository evolves.

## Future Plans
- **Enhanced Notebooks**: Adding personal commentary and insights to the course notebooks.
- **Projects**: Developing and sharing a series of projects applying the concepts learned.
- **In-depth Analyses**: Offering deeper analyses on specific topics covered in the course.

## Usage
This repository is intended for personal, non-commercial educational use. It showcases how to deepen understanding and application of generative AI concepts through enhancements and projects.
