# GenerativeAI-LLMs-DeepDive

## Description
Dive deep into the world of Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs), building upon the "Generative AI with Large Language Models" course by DeepLearning.AI and Amazon Web Services on Coursera. This repository starts by hosting the course materials and will gradually be enhanced with in-depth analyses, personal insights, and a collection of unique projects aimed at exploring the practical applications and versatility of LLMs.

## Repository Structure
Currently, the repository organizes the original course materials. This structure will expand to include additional directories for enhanced notebooks, detailed insights, and projects. For now, the repository is structured into the following main directories:

- `/CourseMaterialEnhanced/` - Hosts both the original and upcoming enhanced versions of the course notebooks. Each week of the course is represented as a subdirectory.
  - `Week1/`, `Week2/`, `Week3/` - Contain the original course notebooks and placeholders for the enhanced versions.
- `/Projects/` - This section, planned for future updates, will contain projects that apply the learned concepts to new challenges or datasets.

Detailed descriptions and updates for each section will be provided as the repository evolves.

## Future Plans
- **Enhanced Notebooks**: Adding personal commentary and insights to the course notebooks.
- **Projects**: Developing and sharing a series of projects applying the concepts learned.
- **In-depth Analyses**: Offering deeper analyses on specific topics covered in the course.

## Usage
For now, feel free to explore the original course materials available. As the repository grows, it will offer more guidance on navigating through enhanced content and projects.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, and if you'd like to help improve the materials, add insights, or contribute projects, please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly to discuss further.
